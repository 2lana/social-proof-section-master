### What I learned

My major learnings while working through this project.

See below:

```html
<div class="verified-buyer-smith">
  <img src="images/image-colton.jpg" alt="image person" />
  <div class="buyer-info">
    <h2 class="name-buyer">Colton Smith</h2>
    <div class="status-buyer">Verified Buyer</div>
  </div>
  <p class="description-buyer">
    "We needed the same printed design as the one we had ordered a week prior.
    Not only did they find the original order, but we also received it in time.
    Excellent!"
  </p>
</div>
```

```css
.buyers {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  padding: 0 3rem 1rem 3rem;
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts still not completely comfortable with or techniques found useful that want to refine and perfect.
